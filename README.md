# Mind Maze – Memory Escape Game

Mind Maze is a terminal-based Python game that tests your memory rather than reflexes.
The maze is shown only once and then hidden — players must navigate from start to exit
using memory alone.

## How to Play

- Memorize the maze when it is displayed
- After it disappears, navigate using:
  - `W` → Up
  - `A` → Left
  - `S` → Down
  - `D` → Right
- Hitting a wall or boundary ends the game

## Features

- True memory-based gameplay
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Works even in Python IDLE
- Clean and beginner-friendly Python code

## Run the Game

```bash
python mind_maze.py
